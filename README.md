This is the readme file created for testing the git skills.
It is going to be the second commit checking the push origin master still works.
The command push origin master works. So going to check push origin is sufficient if the origin master command is already used.
The command git push is not sufficient before the command git push --set-upstream origin master is executed. still checking the git push is sufficent?
