This is the readme file created for testing the git skills.
It is going to be the second commit checking the push origin master still works.
The command push origin master works. So going to check push origin is sufficient if the origin master command is already used.
The command git push is not sufficient before the command git push --set-upstream origin master is executed. still checking the git push is sufficent?



##Feature branch edit :
  This is done in the feature branch for checking the branching in git and how it works.


##Feature branch edit 2 :
  This is for testing how to create pull request using command line. I am thinking of going with the command git pull origin master in the feature branch.
  Checking for auto merging feature in the feature branch
